# Breathing
For my graduation project, I've worked on a videogame that helps you breathe better.
The initial idea was to create an entire videogame with a storyline that gradually makes you
more aware of your breathing patterns. This project took a different direction,
so this wasn't all realised. 

What was left of this project was a flying bird that was controllable via your breath.
This was achieved by using an Arduino with a wind sensor and a belt respiration sensor.
